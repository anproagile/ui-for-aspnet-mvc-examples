# PDF export

## As of Q2 2014, there is built-in support for [PDF export](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/grid/pdf-export). Consider using this approach if you want to customize the exporting in your own way or in case you want to handle it server side.
This project demonstrates how to export the Kendo UI Grid data in PDF format.
