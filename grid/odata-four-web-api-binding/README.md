# Odata 4 with WebAPI controller
This project shows how to configure the dataSource to communicate with the WebAPI controller through the Odata 4 protocol. 
Notice Odata v4 is not fully supported. There is limitation when working with Dates, since [WebAPI does not support DateTime type anymore](http://damienbod.wordpress.com/2014/06/16/web-api-and-odata-v4-crud-and-actions-part-3/). 
WebAPI now uses the DateTimeOffset time as a main type when it comes to dates. However DateTimeOffet requires the [Model](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/data/model)(that the dataSource creates) to keep information for both Date and Offset which is not possible with the current architecture of the DataSource and Model of Kendo.
